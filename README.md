Assignment 2 - Adding Media Queries to Assignment 1 Portfolio

I used the answer key from assignment 1. I created 3 different media queries: 980px, 768px, and 640px. 

I found that my images were breaking between local and heroku because although images were in the relative pathways, the images were saved with capital letters and were being referred to with only lowercase letters in the HTML.
